Change Log
----------

v3.5.0

Fixed blakecoin and vanilla increasing rejects with number of threads.
Removed support for SSE2 Groestl functions. SSE2 groestl remains available
  in v3.4.12 and the legacy branch.
It is no longer necessary to specify stratum+tcp:// in the url, it is assumed
  and is the only supported protocol.

v3.4.12

lyra2z (zcoin) modified for blocks after 8192
fixed scryptjane to support various N factors

v3.4.11

groestl algo AES optimized +200%
myr-gr algo AES optimized +100%

v3.4.10

xevan AES optimized +35%

v3.4.9

fixed zr5, broken in v3.4.8
added xevan algo (Bitsend, BSD) with 10% improvement
added lyra2zoin (Zoin, ZOI) fully optimized but YMMV

v3.4.8

added zcoin support, optimized for AVX2 but no increase in performance
fixed API display of diff for cryptonight
--show-diff is now the default, use "--hide-diff" to disable
cleaned up some cpuminer-multi artifacts

v3.4.7

fixed benchmark, except for x11evo
added CPU temperature to share submission report (Linux only)

v3.4.6

For users:
- cryptolight algo is now supported with AES optimizations
- display format changed for share submissions
    - colour keyed "Accepted" or "Rejected" status.
    - reject count and rate displayed when share is rejected.

For developers:

- code restructuring for detecting new work
    - cleaned up detection and handling of new work
    - removed call to stratum_gen_work from niner_thread.
    - eliminated gen_work_now gate function.
    - renamed gate function init_nonce to get_new_work.
    - renamed gate function alloc_scratchbuf to miner_thread_init,
      removed all scracthbuf references from miner_thread and moved
      implementation to the local algo files of those algos that need it.
    - moved most gate targets from algo-gate.c to cpu-miner.c removing
      most mining related code from algo-gate-api.c.

v3.4.5

fixed stale share rejects mining cryptonight at Nicehash
fixed compile error on Westmere CPUs

v3.4.4

fixed compile errors on Westmere CPUs, this is an interim fix that
  will compile without AES on Westmere
added support for cryptonight at Nicehash, some rejects may be produced
  at Nicehash only.

v3.4.3

imported optimized m7m, +42%

v3.4.2

added veltor algo
tweaked lyra2 AVX/AVX2 code for small improvement.

v3.4.1

big AVX2 optmizations for lyra2 +35%, lyra2v2 +11%, AVX also faster
fixed hmq1725

v3.4.0

fixed Windows compile error introduced in v3.3.9
fixed x11gost, broken in v3.3.7
AVX2 optimizations improving many algos:
   - Lyra2RE  +3%
   - Lyra2REv2  +19%
   - x11gost (sib) +6%
   - x11evo +2.4%
   - c11 +6.9%
   - x11 +5%
   - x13 +5%
   - x14 +3.6%
   - x15 +2.4%
   - x17 +2.8%
   - qubit +8.4%


Compile Instructions
--------------------

Building on linux prerequisites:

It is assumed users know how to install packages on their system and
be able to compile standard source packages. This is basic Linux and
beyond the scope of cpuminer-opt. 



Make sure you have the basic development packages installed.
Here is a good start:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/457526/how-to-install-cpuminer-in-ubuntu

Install any additional dependencies needed by cpuminer-opt. The list below
are some of the ones that may not be in the default install and need to
be installed manually. There may be others, read the error messages they
will give a clue as to the missing package.

The folliwing command should install everything you need on Debian based
packages:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libgmp-dev automake

Building on Linux, see below for Windows.

Dependencies

build-essential  (for Ubuntu, Development Tools package group on Fedora)
automake
libjansson-dev
libgmp-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libssl-dev
pthreads
zlib

tar xvzf [file.tar.gz]
cd [file]

Run build.sh to build on Linux or execute the following commands.

./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -Wall" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=gnu++11" ./configure --with-curl
make

Start mining.

./cpuminer -a algo ...

Building on Windows prerequisites:

msys
mingw_w64
Visual C++ redistributable 2008 X64
openssl, not sure about this

Install msys and mingw_w64, only needed once.

Unpack msys into C:\msys or your preferred directory.

Install mingw__w64 from win-builds.
Follow instructions, check "msys or cygwin" and "x86_64" and accept default
existing msys instalation.

Open a msys shell by double clicking on msys.bat.
Note that msys shell uses linux syntax for file specifications, "C:\" is
mounted at "/c/".

Add mingw bin directory to PATH variable
PATH="/c/msys/opt/windows_64/bin/:$PATH"

Instalation complete, compile cpuminer-opt

Unpack cpuminer-opt source files using tar from msys shell, or using 7zip
or similar Windows program.

In msys shell cd to miner directory.
cd /c/path/to/cpuminer-opt

Run winbuild.sh to build on Windows or execute the following commands.

./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -Wall" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=gnu++11 -fpermissive" ./configure --with-curl
make

The following tips may be useful for older AMD CPUs.

Some users with AMD CPUs without AES_NI have reported problems compiling
with build.sh or "-march=native". Problems have included compile errors
and poor performance. These users are recommended to compile manually
specifying "-march=btver1" on the configure command line.

Support for even older x86_64 without AES_NI or SSE2 is not availble.
